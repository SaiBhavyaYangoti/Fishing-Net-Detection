# Fishing-Net-Detection

This project focuses on detecting fishing nets using a dataset containing separate train and test files. The training dataset includes features that are used to build a model capable of identifying whether a network is fishing or not. Logistic Regression was chosen as the algorithm for this task due to its effectiveness in binary classification problems.

After training the model on the training dataset, it was evaluated using the test dataset. The predictions were then saved to a separate CSV file for further analysis. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to accurately classify network data, aiding in the detection of fishing activities.
